# Functional Utilities

## Currying

Currying is when you create a function that can then later be called multiple times with different arguments.

For example:

```js
_.curry(func, [(arity = func.length)]);

var abc = function (a, b, c) {
  return [a, b, c];
};

var curried = _.curry(abc);

curried(1)(2)(3);
// => [1, 2, 3]

curried(1, 2)(3);
// => [1, 2, 3]
```

Currying allows you to break up arguments passed by the number of arguments.

## Composing

Composing is when you take two functions and combine them.
For example:

```js
const consider = (name) => {
    return `I think it could be... ${name}`;
};

const exclaim = (statement) => {
    return `${statement.toUpperCase()}!`;
}

const blame  = _.compose(consider, exclaim);

blame('you');

// => 'I think it could be... YOU!'
```
