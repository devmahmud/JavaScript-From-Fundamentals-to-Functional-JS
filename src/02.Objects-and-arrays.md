# Objects & Arrays

## Property Access

Assignments with Dots

```js
var person = {}; // declare a person object

person.name = "Mrs. White"; // assign a value to a property

var person = { // object literal notation
    "name": "Mrs. White" // the quotation marks are not needed for a one-word property declaration, JavaScript will assume it is a string
};
```

**Anything that ever uses a dot in JavaScript is an object.**

```js
var person = {};

person.name = "Mrs. White";

var who = person.name;

who; //??

person.name = "Mr. White";

who; //??

who.story //??
```

A primitive value is a string, number, boolean, null, or undefined. A non-primitive value is an object, array, function, promise. Primitive values get passed by value, non-primitive values get passed by reference. If you are passing primitive values, a copy is made, non-primitive values are passed as a reference. This behavior can produce unpredictable results if you are not careful. For example, if you were to assign person.name to a variable i.e. who, then reassign person.name, who would retain the original reference for person.name.

## Arrays

```js
var person = [];

person.name = "Mrs. White";

var who = person.name;

who; //??

typeof person === "array"; //??
```

Arrays are objects, and because of that, the rules are exactly the same. The major difference between an array and an object are the available methods for either, an example of which is .length being an available method for arrays, but not objects. If you check the typeof for the person variable in the code block above, the console should return object.

## Bracket Notation

```js
var person = [];

person.name = "Mrs. White";

var who = person.name;

person[0] = "I was not in the Billiards room";
```

```js
var person = []; // declare a person array
var plea = "wouldShe"

person.name = "Mrs. White"; // assign a vaule to a property

person[plea] = "I would never!"
```

The person[plea] = "I would never!" will create a new property in the person array based on the original value of the plea variable "wouldShe", which will make the person array look like this:

```js
person = [
  name: "Mrs. White",
  wouldShe: "I would never!"
]
```

If the intention was to create a plea key for the person object, then you need to surround the plea with quotes. i.e. person["plea"] = "I would never!". The person array would then look like this:

```js
person = [
  name: "Mrs. White",
  plea: "I would never!"
]
```

Reviewing what we’ve learned about objects and arrays:

- An array is an object that has methods available to it.
- A property string can be passed with dot notation or brackets and quotes.
- Dot notation coerces to a string, but cannot coerce a number to a string, it will result in a SyntaxError. JavaScript will start to evaluate the number as a number and then throw the SyntaxError.
- If you receive a SyntaxError when trying to access a variable within an object with dot notation, use bracket notation and quotes around the variable name to access it.

## Non-Valid Characters

Try not to use non-valid characters as property names, like '^&*', that is not a very good property name both because it uses non-valid characters and it is not named in a very memorable or sensible way. You can certainly use non-valid characters to name your properties, but the name will need to be surrounded by quotes. Try to keep your code to the point and don’t get too fancy.

```js
var box = {};

box['material'] = 'cardboard';
box[0] = 'meow';
box['^&*'] = "testing 123";

var test = box['^&*'];

box = {
  "material": 'cardboard',
  "0": 'meow',
  '^&*': "testing 123"
}
```

### Q&A

Q: What is the difference between an array and an object? (this seems to have already been answered in the previous section)

A: An array is a special kind of object. The most special thing about an array is the .length property which is a property that is computed as you add numerical indices. Numerical indices are different than properties on an array because an array captures that and will increment the length.

If you have an array containing any number of items and add something to an index that does not exist; if you add something to the array at an index position that is more than 1 greater than the current .length [numnber of index positions] of the array, empty values will be inserted until it reaches the requested index position. i.e. original array is `y=[0,1,2,3,4,5]` and you would like to add `y[10]=number`, the array will now be `[0,1,2,3,4,5,,,,number]`

**Arrays are easier to reverse and loop through than objects.**

## Game Characters Challenge

Exercise: Create an object using bracket and dot notation that represents the characters and related data you may find in a game of Clue.

![Clue](../images/clue.jpeg)

Characters Weapons Rooms

```js
var clue = {
    characters: ['Professor Plum', 'Miss Scarlet', 'Mrs. Peacock', 'Mr. Boddy', 'Mrs. White', 'Colonel Mustard', 'The Singing Telegram Girl', 'The Motorist', 'Mr. Green'],
    weapons: ['candlestick', 'dagger', 'lead pipe', 'revolver', 'rope', 'spanner'],
    rooms: ['dining room', 'kitchen', 'study', 'billiard room', 'sunroom', 'ballroom']
}
```

## Game Characters Solution

```js
var game = {};

game.murderer = "??";

game['weapons'] = ['lasers', 'angry cats', 'dish soap'];
// why would you choose an array vs an object? If you have a list of something that is all falling under the same category, an array makes more sense vs an object
```

If you took the above array and made it into an object, it might look something like this:

```js
game['weapons'] = [ // an object(s) 'key' should be the same for each 'value', so that it is predictable.
    {type: 'lasers', location: 'lab'},
    {type: 'angry cats', location: 'dining room'},
    {type: 'dish soap', location: 'sunroom'}
]

game.name = [];

game.name[0] = 'Miss Scarlet';
game.name.push('Mr. Green');
```

## Object Review

### JavaScript Object Rules

You can use dot or bracket notation when working with;

![Notation Rules](../images/object-notation-rules.png)

**Dot Notation:** strings

**Bracket Notation:** strings, numbers, variables, weird characters, expressions

**Why would you even use dot notation?**

**Ans:** Because it is less characters than bracket notation

4. How do you add a property whose key and value are stored in different variables?
5. How do we loop through object to access the values?
6. When can you only use dot notation and not bracket?
7. When can you only use brackets and not dot?
8. How do you add a property with a key that is stored in a variable?
9. How do you access an object that is inside another object?
10. How do you create an object that is nested inside another object?

## ES6 Destructuring

Destructuring is a simplified way of defining variables and taking them outside of an object or an array.

i.e. Destructuring an Array

```js
// create a new array and declare it's values. could use let, var, etc…

const [first, second] = [true, false];

// reassigning values to existing array

[first, second] = [true, false];
```

`const` and `let` are features of ES6

`const` is used when you want the value of the variable to remain constant

`const` will not apply to the properties of the object unless you explicitly ‘freeze’ them using [Object.freeze](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/freeze)

let is used when you want to restrict a variable to a certain scope

i.e. Destructuring an Object

```js
// create a new object and declare it's values. could use let, var, etc…

const {first, second} = {first: true, second: false};

// reassigning values to existing object

{first, second} = {first: true, second: false};
```

Objects do not have an order, but the names do have to match. If you think or expect that an object needs an order, you should be using an array.

## Destructuring Challenge

Create an object that looks like this:

`{“name”: “Rusty”, “room”: “kitchen”, “weapon”: “candlestick”}`

Extract out the weapon and location using destructuring

## Destructuring Solution

`let {name, room, weapon} = {“name”: “Rusty”, “room”: “kitchen”, “weapon”: “candlestick”}`

## Destructuring Examples

On extracting data and working with nested data structures

```js
// Destructuring === arrays

var [a, b] = [1, 2];
console.log(a, b);
// => 1 2

// Omit certain values
var [a, , b] = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(a, b);
// => 1 3

// Combine with spread/rest operator (accumulates the rest of the values)
var [a, ...b] = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(a, b);
// => 1 [ 2, 3 ]

// Swap variables easily without temp
var a = 1, b = 2;
// var temp = a;
// a = b;
// b = temp;
[b, a] = [a, b];
console.log(a, b);
// => 2 1

// Advance deep arrays
var [a, [b, [c, d]]] = [1, [2, [[[3, 4], 5], 6]]];
console.log("a:", a, "b:", b, "c:", c, "d:", d);
// => a: 1 b: 2 c: [ [ 3, 4 ], 5 ] d: 6
// ^ None of the 'Advance deep arrays' example above is useful
```
