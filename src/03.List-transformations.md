## Nesting

Nesting had been talked about earlier, below is an example.

```js
// nesting

const game = {};
game['suspects'] = [];

game.suspects.push({
    name: 'Rusty',
    color: 'orange'
});

game.suspects[1] = {
    name: 'Miss Scarlet',
    color: 'red'
};

// view of object literal

const game = {
    'suspects': [
        {
            name: 'Rusty',
            color: 'orange'
        },
        {
            name: 'Miss Scarlet',
            color: 'red'
        }       
    ]
}
```

Considering the above, what would `game[suspects]` return?

nothing… because the quote marks were missing around ‘suspects’. With the added quote marks, it would return an array with the suspect objects.

## Looping Exercise

Using the nested structure from the previous section, loop through it using any for loop of your choice.

## Looping Solution

```js
function foo() {
    for (let i = 0; i < game.suspects.length; i++) {
        console.log(game.suspects[i]);
    }
}

foo()
```

## Looping Exercise, Part 2

Loop through all of the properties of the suspect objects in the suspects array, mark them if you think they are guilty.

## Looping Solution, Part 2

```js
var gameLoop = function() {
    for (var i = 0; i < game.suspects.length; i++) {
        console.log('outer loop');
        for (var key in game.suspects[i]) {
            console.log('inner loop');
            if (game.suspects[i][key] === 'Rusty') {
                console.log('Found \'em');
            } else {
                console.log('next time!');
            }
        }
    }
}

the above would log:

'outer loop'
'inner loop'
'Found em'
'inner loop'
'next time!'
'outer loop'
'inner loop'
'next time!'
'inner loop'
'next time!'
```

## Looping Exercise, Part 3

Destructure the nested data structure into two variables with the strings ‘red’ and ‘orange’

## Looping Solution, Part 3

```js
const firstColor = game.suspects[0].color;
const secondColor = game.suspects[1].color;

var [color, color2] = [suspects[0].color, suspects[1].color];

var [{color: firstColor}, {color: secondColor}] = suspects; // specifies a specific property of the targeted object and returns an array
```
